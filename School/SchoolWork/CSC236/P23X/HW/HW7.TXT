HW7 - Subroutines 

01.  This subroutine is to copy one list to another list. Input is:         
    si points to the source list and di points to the destination list 
    cx contains the count of bytes in the source list  
    
    subr:   cmp     cx,0        ; is list size zero    
            je      exit        ; if yes we are done   
            push    si          ; save si              
            push    di          ; save di              
            push    cx          ; save cx              
    movr:   mov     al,[si]     ; get a byte           
            mov     [di],al     ; put a byte           
            loop    movr        ; repeat if more chars 
    exit:   pop     cx          ; restore cx           
            pop     di          ; restore di           
            pop     si          ; restore si           
            ret                 ; return to caller     
 
If cx is not zero then which is true about the subroutine's behavior 
A. it saves and restores all registers it modifies             
B. it does not save and restore all registers it modifies      
C. it saves the cx register even though the cx register is not modified    
D. the order in which registers are saved and then restored is not correct 


02.  The input to this routine is a pointer in si that points to a word of   
data in memory.  The routine is to swap the high byte and low byte of   
the data word in memory.  For example if si points the memory data word 
11 22, then the routine should set the memory data word to 22 11.   
                                                                    
      subr:   push  ax                                              
              push  si                                              
              mov   ax,[si]                                         
              mov   [si],ah                                         
              mov   [si+1],al                                       
              pop   si                                              
              pop   ax                                              
              ret                                                   
                                                                    
Which is true about the subroutine's operation.                     
A. The high and low bytes will be swapped for all values of the     
   memory data word.                                                
B. The high and low bytes will be swapped only if both bytes of     
   the memory data word are in the range of hex 00-7F.              
C. The high and low bytes will be swapped only if both bytes of     
   the memory data word are in the range of hex 80-FF.              
D. The high and low bytes will be swapped only if both bytes of     
   the memory data word have the same value.
